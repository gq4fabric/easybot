# easybot
This is a project to make it easier for users to develop ROS2 apps using c++(based on ros2/rclcpp).
It is mainly based on version of ROS2(crystal under ubuntu 1604). U can use it in other version of linux-based ros2 as well.
We suppose that you have installed ROS2, and in some demos you need a well-installed OpenCV.
The key of this project is following 2 files : ezb.sh and easybot.hpp
The "ezb.sh" is a bash script, which provided some interfaces to help you make ROS2 project with less work.
And "easybot.hpp" is an hpp file used a group of c++ Micros to make your c++ code less, cleaner,and easier to read.
